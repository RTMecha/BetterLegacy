snapshot-2025.3.1 - (pre-1.7.0) > [???]

- Moved the Profile menu and Tests menu to a new "Extras" menu on the main menu.
- Reworked Input Select and Load Level menus to use the current interface system.
- Entering the Arcade / Story with players already registered will now skip the Input Select menu.
- Entering the Arcade no longer automatically loads the levels, meaning you can go straight from the main menu to the Arcade menu.
- Reworked beatmap data to not depend on base vanilla data as much. (so many nests and odd names wtf)
- Trying to rework how themes are loaded.
- Shortened file sizes by trimming quotation marks when necessary.
- Due to the beatmap data rework, new "setParent" and "setParentOther" modifiers was added. This temporarily sets the parent of the beatmap object to another, until you update the object or reload the level.
- spawnPrefab modifiers can now find a prefab via different ways: Index, ID and Name.
- Renamed Timeline Waveform type names to better describe what they are. This is done since what was the "Modern" waveform is no longer modern due to modern PA now using the "Beta" waveform.

> Search field filters (default themes, used themes, used prefabs)
> Default prefab / theme paths for level
> Apply This & Create New for the Apply Prefab button in the Object Editor.
> Edit for internal prefabs.
> Prefab offset context menus.

- Hovering the mouse over a transparent object with highlight objects on now sets the object to opaque.
