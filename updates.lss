  - Optimized a ton of level data code.
  - Modifiers are a lot more optimized now (1.7x-ish FPS boost).
  - Timeline Object rendering is also now more optimized. Which basically means switching between layers shouldn't freeze the game as hard as it did before.
  - Creating an event keyframe should no longer freeze the game.
- Reworked the arcade menus to be more consistent with other interfaces in the mod. Still missing a few features but I'll be adding them throughout the next few patches.
- Fixed Background Object shape toggles not being selected.
- Finally implemented Background Object tags. This includes two new modifiers for BG objects: setActiveOther and animateObjectOther. Also includes a new regular object modifier: setBGActive.
- Added BG Global Position toggle to Camera Depth event keyframes. This is to support vanilla Legacy levels that rely on the BG camera being at a specific position. If you made any levels before this change, please do turn the toggle off.
- Added Allow Custom Player Models to the Global tab of the Player Editor. Having it off will force the player to use the player model you set in the editor.
- Added a button that sets the global player model config to the currently selected player model. This is so you can a bit more easily play as a custom player model in whatever level you choose (as long as the feature above is on)
- Changed REPL Editor animation to Text Editor animation. (Completely forgot there was animation configs for a REPL Editor... what)
- Added Context Menus to specific areas of the editor (such as the level list, prefab list, etc). Right click something to open the menu.
- Sub-folders in the prefabs folder can now be navigated via the External Prefabs popup.
- Player boost can now be queued while boost cooldown is on. Includes a config located Config Manager > Player > General.
1.5.8 > [Sep 19, 2024]
- Fixed prefabs not spawning in arcade levels.
- Clear object data when returning to the arcade.

1.5.7 > [Sep 18, 2024]
- Ease Type dropdown not updating keyframe hotfix.
1.5.6 > [Sep 18, 2024]
- Trim the ends of evaluated text.
1.5.5 > [Sep 18, 2024]
- Fixed death_hd being achieved when you exit the editor. (hopefully)
- Updated the way most items are obtained from dictionaries. (This should hopefully mean a slight improvement in performance)
- Added some config based modifiers (configLDM, usernameEquals, languageEquals, etc)
- Added formatText action modifier. This does what Allow Custom Text Formatting config does.
- Added playerCount trigger modifier. (apparently code for this already existed, I just never fully implemented it...)
- Added a ton of functionality to the math evaluators (copyAxisMath, copyAxisGroup, etc). Considering how much it can do, I might add it to some modifiers later if I have any ideas on what ones to do. (also, you can type math into some input fields if you really must)
- Added a QOL text editor for editing an input field's text at a larger scale.
1.5.4 > [Sep 16, 2024]
- Fixed editor levels not loading.
1.5.3 > [Sep 16, 2024]
- Achievements now stack.
- Fixed achievement "editor_zoom_break" having the wrong description.
- Added achievements: no_fps.

- Fixed player model not saving correctly if custom object name is left empty.
1.5.2 > [Sep 15, 2024]
- Reverted player tail position change from last patch. I have no idea how to properly fix the tail problem...
- Implemented Rotate Reset.
- Custom Player objects parented to the boost now scale with it.
- Fixed Flip X face rotation being weird.

- Added achievements: player_select, example_touch, time_machine and time_traveler.
1.5.1 > [Sep 15, 2024]
- Added death_hd achievement.
- Fixed game timeline not clearing previous checkpoint images properly.
- Uploading a level to the arcade server will no longer include VG files (level.vgd & metadata.vgm).
- Replaced Switch to Arcade Mode button in File dropdown with Copy Level to Arcade button. This now copies the current levels' folder into the arcade folder, allowing you to load it from there.
- Added a button under the Edit dropdown for re-rendering the timeline waveform.
- Set pasting objects notification to 5 seconds.
- Made Beatmap Objects only save Gradient Color keyframe values if the object is a gradient.
- Tried fixing player tail positions on player spawn.
1.5.0 > [Sep 14, 2024]
- Implemented internal achievements!
You'll unlock some of the internal ones as you play the game.
Custom achievements will come later once I figure out how to do them.
Do note achievements do not *currently* stack, so if you get multiple at once, you will only see one of them.
You also can't currently view achievements anywhere. Eventually it'll be added to the profile menu.
Here's a list of the current achievements (some names are more obvious than others, so you will need to search around for what these are for)
 - welcome
 - editor
 - no_boost
 - complete_animation
 - costume_party
 - f_rank
 - expert_plus_ss_rank
 - master_ss_rank
 - editor_reverse_speed
 - editor_layer_lol

 - example_chat
 - editor_zoom_break
 - no_volume
 - queue_ten
 - friendship
 - holy_keyframes

 - youve_been_trolled
 - ten_levels
 - fifty_levels
 - one_hundred_levels
- Added gradient objects.
- Fixed cases where the menu music would continue playing in the editor.
- Added translateShape modifier. This can move, scale and rotate the mesh (shape) of the object. Good for offsetting gradient rendering or modifying the dimensions of a shape without needing to make another parent.
- You can now specify multiple keyframe indexes in the Multi Object editor Assign Color section by separating numbers with ",".
- Editor camera should now only toggle on / off when you're in the editor.
- Settings Info time in level now displays days editing.
1.4.9 > [Sep 11, 2024]
- Fixed Config Manager UI not applying theme colors when rounded is on.

- Fixed an error with enable / disableObject modifiers not working.
- Removed the Reactive Color Lerp setting and made it the default.
- Cleaned up BG Object color code.
1.4.8 > [Sep 11, 2024]
- Added a setting for running custom text formatting. This is off by default as having it on can lag levels with a few text objects. Until a more optimized way of getting the custom formatting to work is found, this setting will exist.
- Levels with a ton of text objects should now run a LOT smoother!
- Updated uploading info text (now it's a bit more clear on what you should do when you want to upload your level).
1.4.7 > [Sep 10, 2024]
- Fixed a major bug with the level folder name change in 1.4.5.
1.4.6 > [Sep 10, 2024]
- Added a "Reset" toggle to enable / disableObject modifiers.

- Fixed an old bug with theme editing where it wouldn't always stop using the theme preview.
- Discord status now displays a timer.

1.3.11 > [Aug 30, 2024]
- Added tooltips for modifiers so what they do is finally explained in-editor.
- Added mouse tooltip and notification display multiplier settings. They can be found under Config > Editor > Editor GUI.
- Mouse tooltips now display longer based on how long the text is. If the text is really short, then it will disappear really quickly, otherwise it will stay longer.

- Fixed death and hit count not using the correct counter in some cases.

- Homing keyframe behavior should now be more consistent across all homing types.

1.3.0 > [Aug 24, 2024]

- Updated play level menu to use the new system. The main arcade system will remain the same as it is for the time being.

- Editor Config now has an Editor Complexity setting. This will eventually replace the Show Modded Features setting and will be used for people who prefer a simpler or an advanced editor.
- Added a few "Yield Mode" settings. This is used for the time between each iteration in certain functions. Yield Modes' Null, Delay, EndOfFrame takes longer but doesn't freeze the game, FixedUpdate is quicker but has a chance to lag the game and None is often quicker but will freeze the game for the amount of time it takes to run.

- Reworked the Player Editor.
- Fixed some config values not saving correctly.

- Optimized a ton of stuff compared to the unmerged versions of the mods. (I.E. a level with quite a few modifiers in objects goes from 30 FPS to 100+ FPS)
- Configs now use a custom system with a brand new config menu, which decreases the load times and halving the file size.
