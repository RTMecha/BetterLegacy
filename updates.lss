1.6.0 > [Sep 22, 2024]
- GAME OPTIMIZATIONS!
  - Optimized a ton of level data code.
  - Modifiers are a lot more optimized now (1.7x-ish FPS boost).
  - Timeline Object rendering is also now more optimized. Which basically means switching between layers shouldn't freeze the game as hard as it did before.
  - Creating an event keyframe should no longer freeze the game.
- Reworked the arcade menus to be more consistent with other interfaces in the mod. Still missing a few features but I'll be adding them throughout the next few patches.
- Fixed Background Object shape toggles not being selected.
- Finally implemented Background Object tags. This includes two new modifiers for BG objects: setActiveOther and animateObjectOther. Also includes a new regular object modifier: setBGActive.

- Added Allow Custom Player Models to the Global tab of the Player Editor. Having it off will force the player to use the player model you set in the editor.

- Updated the way most items are obtained from dictionaries. (This should hopefully mean a slight improvement in performance)
- Added some config based modifiers (configLDM, usernameEquals, languageEquals, etc)
- Added formatText action modifier. This does what Allow Custom Text Formatting config does.
- Added playerCount trigger modifier. (apparently code for this already existed, I just never fully implemented it...)
- Added a ton of functionality to the math evaluators (copyAxisMath, copyAxisGroup, etc). Considering how much it can do, I might add it to some modifiers later if I have any ideas on what ones to do. (also, you can type math into some input fields if you really must)
- Added a QOL text editor for editing an input field's text at a larger scale.
1.5.4 > [Sep 16, 2024]

1.5.2 > [Sep 15, 2024]

- Fixed game timeline not clearing previous checkpoint images properly.
- Uploading a level to the arcade server will no longer include VG files (level.vgd & metadata.vgm).

- Added a button under the Edit dropdown for re-rendering the timeline waveform.
- Set pasting objects notification to 5 seconds.
- Made Beatmap Objects only save Gradient Color keyframe values if the object is a gradient.
- Tried fixing player tail positions on player spawn.
1.5.0 > [Sep 14, 2024]
- Implemented internal achievements!
You'll unlock some of the internal ones as you play the game.
Custom achievements will come later once I figure out how to do them.
Do note achievements do not *currently* stack, so if you get multiple at once, you will only see one of them.
You also can't currently view achievements anywhere. Eventually it'll be added to the profile menu.
Here's a list of the current achievements (some names are more obvious than others, so you will need to search around for what these are for)

- Editor camera should now only toggle on / off when you're in the editor.
- Settings Info time in level now displays days editing.
1.4.9 > [Sep 11, 2024]
- Fixed Config Manager UI not applying theme colors when rounded is on.

- Removed the Reactive Color Lerp setting and made it the default.
- Cleaned up BG Object color code.
1.4.8 > [Sep 11, 2024]

- Levels with a ton of text objects should now run a LOT smoother!
- Updated uploading info text (now it's a bit more clear on what you should do when you want to upload your level).

- Fixed an old bug with theme editing where it wouldn't always stop using the theme preview.

- Added tooltips for modifiers so what they do is finally explained in-editor.
- Added mouse tooltip and notification display multiplier settings. They can be found under Config > Editor > Editor GUI.
- Mouse tooltips now display longer based on how long the text is. If the text is really short, then it will disappear really quickly, otherwise it will stay longer.

- Fixed death and hit count not using the correct counter in some cases.

1.3.0 > [Aug 24, 2024]
