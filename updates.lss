1.0.0 > [May 22, 2024]
- Merged all the PA Legacy mods into one new mod called Better Legacy! This merge should make it clear that this version of the game is now a fully different version of PA.
- Modifier updating now occurs before event updating and object updating.
- Reworked a TON of code to be more readable for anyone interested in helping the modding effort.
- Optimized a ton of stuff compared to the unmerged versions of the mods. (I.E. a level with quite a few modifiers in objects goes from 30 FPS to 100+ FPS)
- Configs now use a custom system with a brand new config menu, which decreases the load times and halving the file size.
- The following notes are smaller updates to each mod:
-- Decreased level.lsb file sizes by comparing default values and only saving values when a default value does not equal the current one. (RTFunctions)
-- Background Objects now has Z position. They also have hue, saturation and value for both the base color and the fade color. (RTFunctions)
-- Fixed Background Objects and players not properly clearing and respawning when loading from one level to another. (RTFunctions)
-- Added some new fonts (Pixellet, File Deletion, Sans Sans, Monomaniac One and RocknRoll One).
-- All keyframes can now have their times locked. (EditorManagement)
-- Newly created markers now have their times snapped to BPM if BPM snap is active. (EditorManagement)
-- Made the editor.lse file more readable on the user end.
-- Added the glitch effects Analog Glitch and Digital Glitch. While this was added to EventsCore, I added it to BetterLegacy first. (EventsCore)
-- Example is now more integrated with the mods than before the merge. (ExampleCompanion)
-- Fixed up loadlevel command and added listlevels::path to interface. (PageCreator)
-- Added setMousePosition modifier. (Moves the mouse to the center of the screen at an offset)
-- Added followMousePosition modifier. (Makes the object track the mouse)
-- Added textSequence modifier. (Works like the interface text but more advanced and customizable)
