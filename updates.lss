1.3.7 > [Aug 27, 2024]

- Fixed the metadata.lsb file not saving in some cases.
- Homing keyframe behavior should now be more consistent across all homing types.

1.3.0 > [Aug 24, 2024]

- Editor Config now has an Editor Complexity setting. This will eventually replace the Show Modded Features setting and will be used for people who prefer a simpler or an advanced editor.
- Added a few "Yield Mode" settings. This is used for the time between each iteration in certain functions. Yield Modes' Null, Delay, EndOfFrame takes longer but doesn't freeze the game, FixedUpdate is quicker but has a chance to lag the game and None is often quicker but will freeze the game for the amount of time it takes to run.

- You can now copy and paste every levels' Background Objects into another.

- Levels load a lot faster now.
- Started working on a custom achievement system.
- Added setCollision and setCollisionOther modifiers. These can enable / disable the collision of an object or multiple.

- Configs now use a custom system with a brand new config menu, which decreases the load times and halving the file size.
