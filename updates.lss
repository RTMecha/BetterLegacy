- The following notes are smaller updates to each mod:

-- Background Objects now has Z position. They also have hue, saturation and value for both the base color and the fade color. (RTFunctions)

-- Newly created markers now have their times snapped to BPM if BPM snap is active. (EditorManagement)
-- Made the editor.lse file more readable on the user end.

-- Added setMousePosition modifier. (Moves the mouse to the center of the screen at an offset)
