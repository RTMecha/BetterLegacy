# 1.8.3 [Sep 27, 2025]
## Features
### Core
- Added getAxisMath modifier. Works similarly to the copyAxisMath modifier.
- Added getVisualColorRGBA modifier.
- Certain modifier values can now accept formatting like: "This modifier can {var}" where "var" is "use formatting", so it results in: "This modifier can use formatting".
- Started working on a new "Asset Pack" system. These basically allow you to customize specific mod resources without having to modify the files directly. In the future these will be used to fully customize the game client-side.
  - Asset Packs can be loaded by creating a "assetpacks" folder, creating an Asset Pack folder (will find a way of doing this automatically later) and placing asset files you want to replace / modify / add into the same paths as the files relative to the assets folder.
- Due to the Asset Pack system, the mods' Assets folder has been organized. When updating the mod, feel free to remove the Assets folder before updating so it can have a fresh install.

## Example Companion
- You can now customize Example either by adding parts or replacing the model via the new Asset Pack system. Take a look at Assets/companion/model/parts.json and see if you can make anything with it! :D

## Editor
- The Object Options popup is now editable via the object_templates.json file in the mod Assets folder. This can be customized via Asset Packs.
- Removed the Prefab Example Template setting. If you still need Example's model, you can find it in Upload > View Uploaded > Prefabs, then search "Example".

## Changes
### Core
- The smoothed level time no longer applies to when set music time occurs.
- Tweaked the Beta Player models' control settings to be based on how the player worked at the time.
  - Move Speed = 28
  - Boost Speed = 95
  - Boost Cooldown = 0.11
  - Max Boost Time = 0.16

### Editor
- Uploading a Level / Level Collection / Prefab where its filesize now displays an error message and prevents uploading.
