# 1.8.7 [Oct 5, 2025]
## Features
### Core
- The actorFrameTexture modifier now includes two new values: All Cameras, Clear Texture, BG Custom Color, etc.
  - All Cameras makes the frame display all render layers (BG > FG > UI).
  - Clear Texture clears the previous frame from the current, preventing frame bleeding.
  - BG Custom Color sets a custom background color. Leave empty to use the regular background color.
  - Calculate Zoom is how the zoom usually works. With it off, the zoom value won't depend on the resolution.
  - Texture Offset & Scale fixes the texture being incorrectly positioned. (normally you would have to use translateShape to fix it but that was kinda hacky)
  - Hide Players, well, hides the players.
- setImage modifiers also have Texture Offset & Scale values.

### Editor
- Capture Area now has a setting for capturing all cameras / layers. This is in case you have a prefab that contains BG objects or objects on other render layer types.

## Changes
### Core
- Animation difficulty no longer allows level save data being modified with Zen & Practice modes.
- Moved all object material assets into one Asset Bundle.

## Fixes
- Hopefully fixed level loading breaking in some cases where the player runtime data isn't cleared correctly.
