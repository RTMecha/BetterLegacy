# 1.8.8 [Oct 17, 2025]
## Features
### Editor
- Added FinishTransform keybind function. This allows you to stop the current "transform" (TransformPosition, etc) action without clicking.

## Changes
### Editor
- Undo is now considered for deleting checkpoints.
- Expanding a Prefab Object now allows for undo / redo.

## Fixes
- Fixed invalid Prefab Objects.
- Fixed the undo / redo of deleting. Should be a lot more stable (parenting is remembered now!!).
- Editor history now clears on level load.
