# 1.8.16 [Dec 25, 2025]
## Features
### Core
- Added getLook modifiers for player modifiers.
- Added "Retain Modifiers" value to updateObject modifiers. If set to true and Respawn is off, the modifiers will not be removed from the runtime.
- Added "Parent Self" to Prefab Objects. This makes Prefab Objects act like regular parented objects where the transform origin is at the parent chain instead of the base origin.
- Added "Offset Parent Desync" to Prefab Objects. This makes prefab parenting act like it does in modern versions.
- The player can now jump while upside down if the Allow Reversed Jumping toggle is enabled in the Global tab inside the Player Editor. This also includes a regular Allow Jumping toggle, Allow Wall Jumping toggle and Allow Wall Sticking toggle.
- Added some playerEnableJump modifiers for modifying if the players can jump.
- Polygon shapes now have a Thickness Angle value.
- Added a ton of player trigger and action modifiers.
- New event type: Shockwave.

### Example Companion
- Added a command for selecting objects with the same prefab group.

### Editor
- Added more color keyframe editor context menus.
- Added a path field to the Project Planner.
- Added context menus to the event keyframe editors.
- Project Planner now supports context menus and popups.
- The BG editor now displays the prefab name.
- Added QOL variable rendering for modifier values.
- The Random Types and the Relative toggles in object keyframes can now be hidden.
- Improved editor complexity to include event bins (rows), random types and relative toggles.
- Added more editor popups to Asset Packs.
- Level Collections now have an editor path value. When viewing the levels of the collection, the collections' editor path will be used instead of the actual path.
- Levels now display editing progress. If the progress is 100%, it displays as a checkmark. The level's progress can be set in the settings editor (where you edit the BPM).
- Added OpenMultiObjectEditor keybind function. This can be used to open the Multi Object Editor even if there is only one object selected.
- Added an "Editor Group" system for timeline objects. With this you can organize your objects into groups that can be collapsed / hidden, selected, etc.

## Changes
### Core
- Heavily improved performance of levels.
- Color modifiers should no longer act strangely when used on helper objects.
- Changed the LDM (Low Detail Mode) toggle for objects to have more values, currently only accessible in the context menu for the LDM toggle.
  - Normal = object spawns regardless of LDM setting (unless the object is empty).
  - High Detail Only = object only spawns if the LDM setting is off.
  - Low Detail Only = object only spawns if the LDM setting is on. Good for replacement objects that should display instead of higher detail objects.
  - No Spawn = object never spawns. Only for unused objects you don't want to remove from a level yet.

### Story
- Updated DOC.01's boss level to use the new Shockwave effect and color blend modes, plus tweaked some effects to not be as disorienting.

### Editor
- Show Modified Colors setting now applies to event colors.
- The Character planner is no longer based on folders. Character planners made before this point will need to be remade.
- Changed the default behavior of adding collaborators to opening the search user popup.
- Renamed "Video BG" event to just "Video".
- Event bins no longer display a label if there is no valid event.
- Improved the event editor UI code.
- Improved the workflow of Level Collection editing.
- Optimized object spawning by recalculating the spawner once instead of per modifier.
- Redesigned the Multi Object Editor UI.
- The info that displays for players when a player is hovered over now automatically updates per frame.
