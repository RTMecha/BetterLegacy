# 1.8.21 [Feb 28, 2026]
## Features
### Core
- Background objects now support polygon shapes (sort of). Currently the polygon shape does not support 3D.
- Added some FOV values to the Camera Depth keyframe.
- Added a secret I forgot to add before.

## Fixes
- The axis modifiers with Use Visual on should no longer count the origin offset.
