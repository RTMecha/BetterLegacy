### Major feature
- Level collections.
- Custom Achievement system.
- Story mode.
- Example tutorials. (Either ask Example about something or right click an element to show the context menu with a "Tutorial" button)
- Online multiplayer.
### Minor feature
- Animation editor (for player animations).
- Player modifiers.
- Level modifiers (supports VG triggers).
- 2D option for BG objects (VG parallax support?)
- Camera Jiggle event keyframe? (instead of a single thing that doesn't change throughout the entire level)
- Add feedback (KinoFeedback) effect to event keyframes.
- Add a fake Desktop thing like Rhythm Doctor for Window event keyframes. (The Desktop will look like a PA interface)
- Color picker rework.
- Somehow figure out mutli BG object editing.
- Timeline object index order.
- Figure out custom timeline bin system (Shows a custom amount of rows in the timeline and allows for the timeline to be navigated up and down).
- Unclamped timeline (timeline can be navigated outside the regular range and objects can be placed before start time 0).
- New modifiers [prizeObject, setParent, animateObjectMath, animateObjectMathOther, playerAction (PlayerActionSet) trigger].
- Add a value for spawning a prefab at the object's position.
- Add Set Data to image shape for Custom Player objects.
- More player model limits (move speed, boost speed, etc).
- Prefab preview image. Can set the specific capture size and position.
- Asset sharing on the online server. (Prefabs, themes, player models, etc)
- Collab sharing via server?
- Editor online backups?
### Misc
- Controller Preferences metadata.
- A way to detect duplicate object IDs.
- Config presets (Beginner, Legacy, Alpha, Modded, etc.) that affects editor themes, rounded UI and complexity.
- Some way to replace the song in-editor. (Have the current song update if the song that's being replaced is the same level)
- Possibly update input select scene to use new interface system.
- Glow object that acts like bloom.
- Optimize timeline objects by replacing TextMeshPro with UnityEngine.UI.Text. See if it could be optional?
- Fix spawnPrefab modifier potential issues by not adding to the prefabObjects list, assigning a custom Prefab Object property to Beatmap Object and have ObjectConverter read from that.
- MetaData settings that can be adjusted in the Play Level (Settings) menu and can be read using modifiers probably.
- Figure out how player shooting fits in-game.
- Update dev+ player to have current properties.
- Documentation & tooltips.
- Example customization.
- Somehow figure out how to convert parallax in alpha to BG objects in BetterLegacy.
- Custom end level function [end level screen, return to hub, return to previous, return to arcade, return to main menu].
- loadLevel modifiers custom end function (same as above).
- Possible multi object editor rework???
- Multiplayer editor, possibly. (everyone has their own perspective of the hosts' editor but have limited functionality compared to the host)
### Internal
- Clean up UIManager.
- Clean up PlayerManager.
- Summary and note as much as I can (or need to).
### Bugs
- Fix window event keyframe not resetting when player pauses or when the user exits preview mode.
- Fix up menu themes.
- Fix homing keyframe behaviour. (Going from homing to a normal relative keyframe should prevent the keyframe from moving)
- Fix parent desync not working for specific parent chains.
