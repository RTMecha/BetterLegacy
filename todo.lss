- New modifiers [prizeObject, setParent, playerAction (PlayerActionSet) trigger].
- Prefab preview image. Can set the specific capture size and position.
- Asset sharing on the online server. (Prefabs, themes, player models, etc)

### Misc
- Rework arcade menu to use new interface system.
- Possibly update input select scene to use new interface system.
- Fix spawnPrefab modifier potential issues by not adding to the prefabObjects list, assigning a custom Prefab Object property to Beatmap Object and have ObjectConverter read from that.
- Add a value for spawning a prefab at the object's position.
- MetaData settings that can be adjusted in the Play Level (Settings) menu and can be read using modifiers.
- Allow custom player models in Global tab Player Editor. (Prevents players from loading in their own custom models).
- Add Set Data to image shape for Custom Player objects.
- More player model limits (move speed, boost speed, etc, allow / disallow custom models).
- Figure out how player shooting fits in-game.
- Add a fake Desktop thing like Rhythm Doctor for Window event keyframes.
- Documentation & tooltips.
- Example customization.
- Fully implement Background Object tags.
- Custom end level function [end level screen, return to hub, return to previous, return to arcade, return to main menu].
- loadLevel modifiers custom end function (same as above).
- Possible multi object editor rework???
- Add feedback (KinoFeedback) effect to event keyframes.
- Multiplayer editor, possibly. (everyone has their own perspective of the hosts' editor but have limited functionality compared to the host)
### Internal
- Clean up UIManager.
- Summary and note as much as I can (or need to).
### Bugs
- Fix window event keyframe not resetting when player pauses or when the user exits preview mode.
- Fix up menu themes.
- Fix homing keyframe behaviour. (Going from homing to a normal relative keyframe should prevent the keyframe from moving)
- Fix parent desync not working for specific parent chains.
